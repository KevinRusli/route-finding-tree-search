"""A* search (AS), informed: orders the frontier by f(n) = g(n) + h(n).

g(n) is the cost of the path from the origin to n, and h(n) is the
straight-line distance from n to the nearest destination. The frontier is a
priority queue (heap) of (f, node, counter, g, path): equal f is broken by the
smaller node number, then by the order nodes were added (counter).

Contract: see README.md and AGENTS.md.
