"""Depth-first search (DFS), uninformed.

Frontier is a stack (LIFO): the most recently generated node is expanded next.
Because neighbors() already comes out in ascending order, and each node's
neighbors are pushed in that order, popping from the end of the stack means
the smallest-numbered child is explored first (push ascending, pop reverses
to pop the smallest last in, which goes first) -- see the reversed() below.

Contract: see README.md and AGENTS.md.
