"""Greedy best-first search (GBFS), informed.

Frontier is a priority queue sorted only by h(n), the estimated
straight-line distance to the nearest goal. The cost already paid to
reach a node is ignored, only how close it looks. That is the "greedy"
part, and what separates this from A*.

Contract: README.md and AGENTS.md.
